The Oracle Exadata Database Machine is engineered to deliver dramatically better performance, cost-effectiveness, 
and availability for Oracle databases. Exadata features a modern cloud-enabled architecture with scale-out high-performance database servers,
scale-out intelligent storage servers with state-of-the-art PCIe flash,
leading-edge storage cache using persistent memory, and cloud-scale RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) internal fabric that connects all servers and storage.
Unique algorithms and protocols in Exadata implement database intelligence in storage, compute, and networking to deliver higher performance and capacity at 
lower costs than other platforms, for all types of modern database workloads, including Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), Data Warehousing (DW), 
In-Memory Analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), financial, gaming and compliance data management, as well as efficient consolidation of mixed workloads.

Simple and fast to implement, the Exadata Database Machine X9M-2 powers and protects your most important databases. 
Exadata can be purchased and deployed on-premises as the ideal foundation for a private database cloud, or using a subscription model and deployed 
in the Oracle Public Cloud or Cloud at Customer with all infrastructure management performed by Oracle. The Oracle Autonomous Database is available on 
either the Oracle Public Cloud or Cloud at Customer.
