Star and snowflake schema designs are mechanisms to separate facts and dimensions into separate tables. Snowflake schemas 
further separate the different levels of a hierarchy into separate tables. In either schema design, each table is related to another table
with a primary key/foreign key relationship. Primary key/foreign key relationships are used in relational databases to define many-to-one
relationships between tables.

Star Schema:
Star schema is the type of multidimensional model which is used for data warehouse. In star schema,
The fact tables and the dimension tables are contained. In this schema fewer foreign-key join is used.
This schema forms a star with fact table and dimension tables.

Snowflake Schema:
Snowflake Schema is also the type of multidimensional model which is used for data warehouse. In snowflake schema, The fact tables, 
dimension tables as well as sub dimension tables are contained. This schema forms a snowflake with fact tables, dimension tables as well as sub-dimension tables.
